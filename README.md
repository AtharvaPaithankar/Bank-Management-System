# Bank-Management-System
This is a simple console-based Bank Management System written in C++. It facilitates core banking operations such as user registration, authentication, deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry. The project focuses on the use of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to keep the code modular and maintainable.

Key Concepts & Features:-
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
The User class encapsulates data (username, password, balance) and methods for operations like deposit, withdraw, and balance checking, demonstrating key OOP concepts like encapsulation and abstraction.

Authentication System:
The system supports user login and signup. Authentication is performed using simple string matching and validation logic.

Dynamic Data Storage:
User accounts are stored in a dynamic container (vector<User>), allowing scalable user management without predefined limits.

Pointer Handling:
The currently logged-in user is managed using a pointer (User* currentUser), enabling session-specific operations.

Menu-Driven Interface:
The application is interactive, using loops and switch-case logic to offer users a structured and intuitive experience.
